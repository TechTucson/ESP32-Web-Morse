# ESP32-Web-Morse

The idea here is to create an Arduino/ESP32 project that:

 - WIll Have a Access Point which we can connect to
 - Will host a website
 - Will have predetermined buttons you click that will send out (pre built messages in) morse code on (initially) on the built in LED
 - Will allow the user to input their custom message and send out in morse code on (initially) on the built in LED
 - Will buzz some sound in the future.
